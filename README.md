# My personal boilerplate - angularjs1 - meteor

This is my personal boilerplate to start a angular1+meteor project.

* Generic names for files/folders.

* Use of es6 classes and modules

* Angular material design and material icons available.

It's based on this tutorial:
https://www.angular-meteor.com/tutorials/socially/angular1

This repository will be updated as I move forward with my projects/knowledge base in angular+meteor.
